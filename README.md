<strong><u>Assignment Tasks</u></strong>

**1. Dataset Exploration**

Load and examine the Can Path Student Dataset (Not Imputed).  
Conduct an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key features and relationships.  

**2. Baseline PCA Model**  

Implement a baseline PCA model with default parameters.  
Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.  

**3. Cluster Selection Tuning**  

Identify key decisions related to cluster selection.  
Use techniques to find the optimal configuration.  
Document the process using an RMarkdown File.  

**4. PCA Regression Model Comparisons**  

Conduct a PCA regression using your original cluster selection (Part 2 - Baseline PCA Model) and your tuned model (Part 3 - Cluster Select):  
Use BMI as the outcome variable for the PCA regression. This will Analyze differences in performance using quantitative metrics and discuss possible reasons for the results.  

**5. Feature Importance Analysis**

Extract and interpret feature importance scores from the PCA regression from the best fitting model.  
Visualize the top contributing features and discuss their relevance to the dataset.
